          The Geneva convention is a set of international laws that protect injured soldiers and civilians during war . The law makes sure that every person is treated well and with respect .The first treaty was written in 1864 but it is often changed due to different types of war . It was significantly updated in 1949 after world war two .
Syria is one of 200 countries in the world that agrees to follow the laws of the Geneva convention .The agreement is important because during war a country might need help from neutral organizations to care for the wounded .
The Red Crescent is one of the organizations that provides aid during times of war .It also helps injured people during peacetime , and you may have seen ambulances with red crescent symbol in the street . Countries who follow the laws of the Geneva convention must not attack civilians , <b style='border-bottom: 1px solid black;'>they</b> are not allowed to fight someone who is already hurt . It is illegal to ignore these rules , and a country found guilty of committing war crimes will be tried in a court of law and can severely punished.
 All soldiers , civilians and prisoners may receive medical help from doctors and nurses . They can be taken to a hospital without being attacked . Food can also be given to people involved in a conflict .
